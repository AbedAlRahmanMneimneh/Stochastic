# Bank Operational Dynamics Analysis Using Markov Chains

## Objective
To analyze the operational dynamics of a bank using Markov Chains and Birth-Death Processes, where the state of the system is observed hourly during business hours (8:00 AM to 4:00 PM).

## Part 1: Markov Chain Model

### Step 1: Data Collection and Transition Probability Matrix
**Approach:**
- Simulate data for five days (8 hours/day) for hourly observations of the queue states and teller activity.
- Define the states:
  - 0: No customers in queue.
  - 1: Few customers (1-3).
  - 2: Moderate queue (4-7 customers).
  - 3: Long queue (>7 customers) (special state).
  - 4: Idle period (no transactions, staff handling paperwork).
- Track the number of tellers actively serving customers and their transaction completion times.

**Generated Data:**
Simulated transition data for 5 days and the corresponding transition probability matrix.

### Step 2: Analysis Using the Markov Chain Model

1. **Probability Distribution:**
   - Compute the probability of transitioning from an empty queue to a long queue state within `t` hours (for t = 3, 4, 5, ..., 8).

2. **Probability of Long Queue at 12:00 PM:**
   - Use the transition probability matrix to calculate the probability of state 3 at 12:00 PM.

3. **Expected Number of Long Queues:**
   - Determine the expected number of times state 3 is observed during the day.

4. **Expected Time in Long Queue State:**
   - Compute the expected time spent in state 3.

5. **Long-Run Probabilities:**
   - Calculate the steady-state probabilities of each state.

6. **Expected Steps to Long Queue:**
   - Compute the expected number of steps to first reach state 3 starting from state 0.

7. **Expected Time to Return to Long Queue:**
   - Estimate the expected time to return to state 3 after leaving it.

## Part 2: Markov Process Model

### Step 1: Transition Rate Matrix
**Formula:**

$$
\lambda_{ij} = \frac{\text{Total number of transitions from state } i \text{ to state } j}{\text{Total duration (hours) spent in state } i}
$$
- Simulate the total transitions and duration in each state to construct the transition rate matrix.

### Step 2: Analysis Using the Markov Process Model

1. **Steady State Probabilities:**
   - Compute the steady-state probabilities for all states.

2. **Mean Sojourn Times:**
   - Calculate the mean time spent in each state before transitioning.

3. **Mean First Passage Time:**
   - Compute the mean time to first transition from state 3 to all other states.

## Part 3: Birth-Death Process

### Step 1: Transition Rate Matrix for Tellers
**Assumptions:**
- The number of states is equal to the maximum number of tellers (N).
- Service times follow an exponential distribution with an average service time.

**Generated Data:**
Simulated service times and customer arrivals to construct the transition rate matrix.

### Step 2: Analysis Using the Birth-Death Process Model

1. **Long-Run Probabilities:**
   - Assess teller utilization.

2. **Likelihood of All Tellers Busy:**
   - Compute the probability that all tellers are busy at 12:00 PM.

3. **Expected Time in Each State:**
   - Estimate how long the system stays in each state before transitioning.

4. **Expected Time to Full Occupancy:**
   - Calculate the expected time before all tellers are occupied for the first time.

5. **Impact of Increasing Tellers:**
   - Analyze how increasing the number of tellers affects service efficiency and congestion probabilities.

6. **Frequency of Full Capacity:**
   - Determine how often the system reaches full capacity during the working day.
