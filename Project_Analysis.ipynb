    "# Bank Operational Dynamics Analysis Using Stochastic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a comprehensive analysis of bank queue behaviors and operational dynamics using stochastic modeling approaches. We'll analyze how customers move through different queue states during business hours, calculate various probability metrics, and provide insights to optimize staffing and improve customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This analysis consists of three main parts:\n",
    "1. Markov Chain Model - Discrete-time analysis of queue states\n",
    "2. Markov Process Model - Continuous-time analysis with transition rates\n",
    "3. Birth-Death Process - Analysis of teller utilization\n",

    "- **State 0**: No customers in queue\n",
    "- **State 1**: Few customers (1-3)\n",
    "- **State 2**: Moderate queue (4-7 customers)\n",

    "**How:** The code below imports several pre-written packages that provide functions for mathematical calculations (`numpy`), handling data tables (`pandas`), creating charts (`matplotlib`), and specific calculations for our models (`scipy.linalg.expm`, `math`). Think of it like gathering your calculator, spreadsheet software, and graphing paper before starting your homework.\n",

    "The transition probability matrix is a fundamental component of Markov Chain analysis. It shows the probability of moving from one state to another in a single time step (in our case, one hour). Each entry P(i,j) represents the probability of transitioning from state i to state j.\n",

    "### Calculating the Transition Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** This code performs the calculation described above to create the transition probability matrix from the loaded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define a Function:** It first defines a reusable set of instructions called `construct_transition_matrix` that takes the sequence of observed states as input. This is like writing down a recipe.\n",
    "2.  **Identify States:** Inside the function, it figures out the unique states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n",
    "3.  **Count Transitions:** It creates an empty grid (initialized with zeros) to store the counts. It then goes through the data hour by hour, looking at the current state and the next state, and adds 1 to the corresponding cell in the grid (e.g., if it went from state 0 to state 1, it adds 1 to the cell in row 0, column 1).\n",
    "4.  **Calculate Probabilities:** After counting, it creates another empty grid for the probabilities. For each starting state (each row in the count grid), it divides the counts in that row by the total number of times that starting state was observed. This converts counts to probabilities (e.g., if state 0 was seen 50 times, and the transition 0 -> 1 happened 10 times, the probability is 10/50 = 0.2).\n",
    "5.  **Use the Function:** It takes the 'State' column from our loaded `bank_data`.\n",
    "6.  **Call the Function:** It runs the `construct_transition_matrix` function (the recipe) using this state data.\n",
    "7.  **Print Result:** Finally, it prints the calculated probability matrix, rounding the numbers to make them easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output is the Transition Probability Matrix. \n",
    "- Each row corresponds to a starting state (0 to 4).\n",
    "- Each column corresponds to the state in the next hour (0 to 4).\n",
    "- The number at row `i`, column `j` is the probability of going from state `i` to state `j` in one hour. For example, the number `0.231` in the first row, second column means there's a 23.1% chance that if the bank has no customers now (state 0), it will have few customers (state 1) in the next hour.\n",
    "- The numbers in each row add up to approximately 1 (or 100%), representing all possibilities for the next hour."

    "\n",
    "**Why:** This code calculates the long-run probabilities (steady state) based on the transition matrix we created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Power Function:** It defines a helper function `matrix_power` that calculates the result of multiplying the transition matrix by itself `n` times. This simulates `n` hours of transitions.\n",
    "2.  **Define Steady State Function:** It defines the main function `calculate_steady_state` which takes the transition matrix `P` as input.\n",
    "3.  **Simulate Many Steps:** Inside this function, it uses `matrix_power` to raise the transition matrix `P` to a high power (here, 20). This simulates 20 steps (hours) of transitions. After many steps, the probabilities tend to stabilize.\n",
    "4.  **Extract Result:** After raising to a high power, all rows of the resulting matrix become virtually identical. The function takes the first row as the steady-state distribution (the stabilized probabilities).\n",
    "5.  **Calculate for Our Matrix:** It calls `calculate_steady_state` using the `transition_matrix` we calculated from the bank data.\n",
    "6.  **Print Result:** It prints the resulting steady-state probabilities, rounded for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output is a list of five numbers, representing the Steady State Distribution.\n",

    "- The second number (`0.353`) is the long-run probability of being in State 1 (Few customers) - about 35.3% of the time.\n",
    "- And so on for State 2 (Moderate queue, ~20.6%), State 3 (Long queue, ~10.9%), and State 4 (Idle, ~6.3%).\n",

    "5.  **Add Details:** It adds a title (\"Long-run probabilities...\"), labels the vertical axis (\"Probability\"), and rotates the labels on the horizontal axis (the state names) so they don't overlap.\n",

    "### Calculating the Probability of Reaching Long Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** This code calculates the chances asked in Question 1: the probability of going from State 0 (Empty) to State 3 (Long queue) within a specific number of hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Start/End:** It sets the starting state (`initial_state = 0`) and the target state (`target_state = 3`).\n",
    "2.  **Loop Through Hours:** It uses a loop to check for different time periods, from 3 hours up to 8 hours (`range(3, 9)` means 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n",
    "3.  **Calculate Multi-Step Probabilities:** Inside the loop, for each number of `hours`, it uses the `matrix_power` function (defined earlier) to calculate the transition probabilities over that many steps. For example, `matrix_power(transition_matrix, 3)` gives the probability of going from any state `i` to any state `j` in exactly 3 hours.\n",
    "4.  **Extract Specific Probability:** From this multi-hour transition matrix (`n_step_matrix`), it picks out the number located at the row corresponding to the `initial_state` (row 0) and the column corresponding to the `target_state` (column 3). This is the specific probability we want: P(State is 3 after `hours` | State was 0 initially).\n",
    "5.  **Print Result:** It prints the calculated probability for each number of hours, formatted to three decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output shows the probability for each time horizon.\n",
    "- `After 3 hours: 0.089` means there is an 8.9% chance of being in the 'Long queue' state 3 hours after starting in the 'No customers' state.\n",
    "- `After 4 hours: 0.118` means an 11.8% chance after 4 hours.\n",
    "- The probability generally increases as the number of hours increases, because there's more time for the queue to potentially build up."

    "**Why:** This code calculates the chance of a long queue specifically at 12 PM, assuming the bank started empty (State 0) at 8 AM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Opening State:** It represents the state at 8 AM as a probability distribution where State 0 has 100% probability and all others have 0%. This is stored in `opening_distribution` as `[[1.], [0.], [0.], [0.], [0.]]`.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate 4-Hour Transition:** It calculates the transition probabilities over 4 hours (from 8 AM to 12 PM) using `matrix_power(transition_matrix, 4)`. This gives the matrix of probabilities for moving between states in exactly 4 hours.\n",
    "3.  **Calculate 12 PM Distribution:** It performs a matrix multiplication (`@`) between the transposed `opening_distribution` and the 4-hour transition matrix. The result (`distribution_at_12pm`) is a new distribution showing the probability of being in each of the five states at 12 PM, given the start at 8 AM.\n",
    "4.  **Extract Long Queue Probability:** It takes the fourth number (index 3) from the resulting `distribution_at_12pm`, which corresponds to the probability of being in State 3 (Long queue) at 12 PM.\n",
    "5.  **Print Result:** It prints this specific probability, formatted to four decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output number (`0.1184`) is the calculated probability. It means there is an 11.84% chance that the bank will be experiencing a long queue at 12 PM, assuming it started empty at 8 AM."

    "2.  **Multiply by Hours:** It multiplies this steady-state probability by the number of hours in the business day (9). If the bank spends, say, 11% of its time in State 3, then over 9 hours, we expect to observe it in State 3 for about 0.11 * 9 hours.\n",

    "**Why:** This code calculates the average time the bank spends in the 'Long queue' state (State 3) *each time* it enters that state, before it transitions to a different state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Get Probability of Staying:** It looks at the `transition_matrix` and finds the probability of staying in State 3, given that the bank is currently in State 3. This is the value in row 3, column 3 (remembering that indices start at 0, so this is `transition_matrix[3,3]`).\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Expected Time:** The average time spent in a state (called the expected sojourn time in discrete time) is calculated using the formula: `1 / (1 - probability_of_staying_in_the_state)`. This formula comes from the properties of geometric distributions related to Markov chains.\n",
    "3.  **Print Result:** It prints the calculated time in hours, formatted to four decimal places.\n",

    "**Output Explanation:** The output number (`1.0000 hours`) is the average duration, in hours, that the bank remains in the 'Long queue' state each time it enters that state.

    "\n",
    "2. **Critical Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Long queues occur on average about once per day (0.98 expected occurrences)\n",
    "   - It takes approximately 7.8 steps (hours) on average to first reach a long queue from an empty state\n",
    "   - After a long queue dissipates, it takes about 9.2 steps (hours) on average before another long queue forms\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operational Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Schedule additional staff around midday when the probability of long queues increases\n",
    "   - Consider implementing a teller rotation system to handle the approximately 1 hour per day of long queue situations\n",
    "   - Optimize staffing during periods where the bank is frequently in state 0 (no customers) or state 4 (idle)\n",

    "1.  **Define Function:** It defines a function `construct_transition_rate_matrix` that takes the sequence of observed states.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize:** Inside, it sets up grids to count transitions (`transitions_count`) and also an array to track the total time spent in each state (`state_durations`), initializing both with zeros.\n",

    "    *   It increments the count in `transitions_count[current_state, next_state]`.\n",
    "    *   It adds 1 hour to the total time spent in the `current_state` (`state_durations[current_state]`).\n",
    "4.  **Handle Last State:** It adds 1 hour to the duration of the very last state observed in the data.\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Rates:** It creates an empty grid `transition_rates`. It then loops through all possible pairs of states (`i`, `j`). If `i` is different from `j` and the time spent in state `i` (`state_durations[i]`) is greater than zero, it calculates the rate `λij` using the formula: `rate = transitions_count[i, j] / state_durations[i]`.\n",
    "6.  **Calculate Diagonal Rates:** For each state `i`, it calculates the diagonal rate `λii` by summing up all the outgoing rates from that state (`transition_rates[i, j]` for all `j` different from `i`) and taking the negative of the sum. This ensures that the sum of each row in the final rate matrix is zero.\n",
    "7.  **Use Function:** It calls the `construct_transition_rate_matrix` function using the 'State' data from `bank_data`.\n",
    "8.  **Print Result:** It prints the resulting rate matrix (`transition_rate_matrix`), rounded for readability.\n",

    "- **Diagonal numbers** (e.g., row 0, column 0: `-0.615`) are negative and represent the total rate of *leaving* the row state (to any other state).

    "\n",
    "**Why:** To find the long-run average time spent in each queue state (0-4), using the transition *rate* matrix calculated just before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:** Finding the steady state (`pi`) for a continuous-time process involves solving a system of linear equations. The equations come from the idea that in the long run, the rate of flow *into* a state must equal the rate of flow *out* of it. Mathematically, this is represented by `pi * Q = 0` (where `Q` is the rate matrix), plus the condition that all probabilities must sum to 1 (`sum(pi) = 1`).\n",
    "1.  **Get Rate Matrix:** It uses the `transition_rate_matrix` calculated previously.\n",
    "2.  **Transpose Matrix:** It takes the transpose of the rate matrix (`Q = transition_rate_matrix.T`). This is often done to set up the equations in the standard `A * x = b` format.\n",
    "3.  **Set up Equations:** It creates a larger matrix `A` by stacking the transposed rate matrix `Q` on top of a row of all ones. It creates a vector `b` which is all zeros except for the last element, which is 1. This combines the `pi * Q = 0` and `sum(pi) = 1` conditions into a single system `A * pi = b`.\n",
    "4.  **Solve System:** It uses `np.linalg.lstsq` (Least Squares solver, a robust method for potentially tricky systems) to find the vector `pi` (named `steady_state` here) that best solves `A * pi = b`.\n",
    "5.  **Print Result:** It loops through the calculated `steady_state` vector and prints the probability for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output lists the long-run probabilities for each state (0 to 4), calculated using the continuous-time model.\n",

Let `m_ij` be the average time to first reach state `j` starting from state `i`. For a fixed target state `j`, the MFPTs satisfy the equations: `Σ(k) λ_ik * m_kj = -1` for all `i ≠ j`, with the boundary condition `m_jj = 0`.

    "        *   If `i` is *not* the `target` state, set up the equation `Σ(k) λ_ik * m_kj = -1`. This involves putting the rates `λ_ik` (from `transition_rate_matrix[i, k]`) into the `i`-th row of matrix `A` as coefficients for the unknown `m_kj`, and setting `b[i] = -1`.\n",

    "### Constructing the Birth-Death Rate Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** To create the specific transition rate matrix (`Q`) for the teller utilization model, based on the Birth-Death process assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Function:** Define `construct_birth_death_matrix` that takes the maximum number of tellers (`max_tellers`), the customer arrival rate (`arrival_rate`, λ), and the service rate per teller (`service_rate`, μ).\n",
    "2.  **Determine States:** The number of states is `max_tellers + 1` (from 0 busy tellers up to `max_tellers` busy tellers).\n",
    "3.  **Initialize Matrix:** Create an empty rate matrix `Q` of the correct size, filled with zeros.\n",
    "4.  **Fill Off-Diagonal Rates:** Loop through each state `i` (number of busy tellers):\n",
    "    *   **Birth (Arrival):** If `i` is less than `max_tellers`, set the rate from `i` to `i+1` (`Q[i, i+1]`) to the `arrival_rate` (λ). Assumes arrivals happen regardless of how many tellers are busy, as long as there's a free one.\n",
    "    *   **Death (Service Completion):** If `i` is greater than 0, set the rate from `i` to `i-1` (`Q[i, i-1]`) to `i * service_rate` (i * μ). The total service rate increases with the number of busy tellers.\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Diagonal Rates:** After filling the off-diagonals, loop through each state `i` again. Calculate the diagonal element `Q[i, i]` as the negative sum of all other elements in row `i`. This ensures each row sums to zero.\n",
    "6.  **Estimate Parameters from Data:**\n",
    "    *   Get `max_tellers` by finding the maximum value in the 'Active_Tellers' column of the `bank_data`.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the average service time in hours (`avg_service_time_hours`) from the 'Avg_Transaction_Time_Min' column. Calculate the service rate per teller `μ = 1 / avg_service_time_hours`.\n",
    "    *   Estimate the customer arrival rate `λ`. This code uses a simple approximation: it estimates the average number of customers in the system (`avg_customers`) based on the queue states (0-4) observed in Part 1/2, and then estimates `λ` roughly using a variation of Little's Law (`λ ≈ avg_customers * service_rate / max_tellers`). *Note: This is a simplification; arrival rate could be estimated differently.*\n",
    "7.  **Call Function:** Call `construct_birth_death_matrix` with the determined `max_tellers` and the estimated `arrival_rate` and `service_rate`.\n",
    "8.  **Print Parameters & Matrix:** Print the values used for `max_tellers`, `avg_service_time_hours`, `service_rate` (μ), `arrival_rate` (λ), and the resulting Birth-Death rate matrix (`bd_matrix`).\n",
    "9.  **Calculate Traffic Intensity:** Calculate `ρ = arrival_rate / (service_rate * max_tellers)`. This measures the offered load relative to the total service capacity.\n",
    "10. **Print Traffic Intensity:** Print the calculated `ρ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Parameters:** Shows the values used in the model: 5 tellers maximum, average service time ~0.05 hours (~3 minutes), service rate per teller ~19.3 customers/hour, estimated arrival rate ~10.7 customers/hour.\n",
    "- **Birth-Death Rate Matrix:** Shows the `Q` matrix. Note its structure: non-zero values only on the main diagonal (negative), the super-diagonal (rate `λ` = 10.71), and the sub-diagonal (rate `i * μ`, e.g., for row 1 it's 1*19.29, for row 2 it's 2*19.29=38.57, etc.).\n",
    "- **Traffic intensity (ρ):** The value `0.1111` (or ~11%) is much less than 1. This indicates that the overall service capacity (5 tellers * 19.3 customers/hour/teller ≈ 96.5 customers/hour) is significantly higher than the estimated arrival rate (10.7 customers/hour). This suggests the system is generally not overloaded according to this model and these parameters."

    "### Calculating Steady State Probabilities (Teller Busyness)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** To find the long-run probability of having exactly 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 tellers busy, based on the Birth-Death model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Function:** It reuses the `calc_steady_state` function defined earlier. This function solves the system of equations `pi * Q = 0` and `sum(pi) = 1` to find the steady-state probabilities `pi` for a given rate matrix `Q`.\n",
    "2.  **Get Number of States:** Determine the number of states (`n_states`) from the size of the `bd_matrix` (which is `max_tellers + 1 = 6`).\n",
    "3.  **Call Function:** Call `calc_steady_state` using the `bd_matrix` calculated in the previous step. The result is stored in the `steady_state` variable.\n",
    "4.  **Print Probabilities:** Loop through the `steady_state` probabilities and print each one, indicating the number of occupied tellers it corresponds to.\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Expected Busy Tellers:** Calculate the average number of busy tellers in the long run. This is done by summing `(number_of_busy_tellers * probability_of_that_number)` for all states (0 to 5). Formula: `Sum(i * steady_state[i] for i from 0 to 5)`.\n",
    "6.  **Calculate Utilization:** Calculate the overall average teller utilization. This is the expected number of busy tellers divided by the maximum number of tellers (`max_tellers`, which is 5).\n",
    "7.  **Print Metrics:** Print the calculated expected number of busy tellers and the average utilization percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Steady-state probabilities:** Shows the long-run chance of finding a specific number of tellers busy.\n",
    "    - `0 tellers occupied: 0.5738` (Bank is empty ~57.4% of the time).\n",
    "    - `1 tellers occupied: 0.3188` (~31.9% chance of 1 busy teller).\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "    - `5 tellers occupied: 0.0003` (All 5 tellers are busy only ~0.03% of the time).\n",
    "- **Expected number of busy tellers:** `0.56`. On average, slightly more than half a teller is busy in the long run.\n",
    "- **Average teller utilization:** `11.11%`. This is calculated as (0.56 / 5). This low utilization percentage reflects the high probability of having 0 or 1 teller busy and the very low probability of having many tellers busy, according to this model and the estimated parameters."

    "**Why:** To find the probability of having different numbers of tellers busy specifically at 12 PM, assuming the bank started with 0 busy tellers at 8 AM. This looks at the system *before* it necessarily reaches its long-run steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Initial State:** Create an array `initial_state` representing the probability distribution at 8 AM. It's `[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`, meaning 100% probability of being in state 0 (0 busy tellers).\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Time Evolution Matrix:** Use the 'matrix exponential' function (`expm`) from the `scipy.linalg` library. `expm(bd_matrix * 4)` calculates a matrix `P(4)` where `P(4)[i, j]` is the probability of transitioning from state `i` to state `j` in exactly 4 hours (from 8 AM to 12 PM).\n",
    "3.  **Calculate 12 PM Distribution:** Multiply the `initial_state` distribution by the `P(4)` matrix (`initial_state @ P_4hours`). The result (`distribution_at_12pm`) is the probability distribution across the states (0 to 5 busy tellers) at 12 PM.\n",
    "4.  **Print Distribution:** Loop through `distribution_at_12pm` and print the probability for each number of busy tellers at 12 PM.\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Specific Probabilities:**\n",
    "    *   Extract the probability that *all* tellers are busy (State 5) at 12 PM. This is the last element of `distribution_at_12pm` (`distribution_at_12pm[-1]`).\n",
    "    *   Calculate the probability of queue formation. In this model (tracking only busy tellers up to `max_tellers`), this is equivalent to the probability that all tellers are busy.\n",
    "6.  **Print Specific Probabilities:** Print the calculated probability of all tellers being busy and the probability of queue formation at 12 PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:**\n",

    "**Why:** To explore how key performance metrics (like the chance of all tellers being busy) change if the bank were to operate with a different number of tellers (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:**\n",
    "1.  **Define Analysis Function:** Create a function `analyze_varying_tellers` that takes the arrival rate (λ), service rate (μ), and a list/range of teller numbers (`teller_range`) to test.\n",
    "2.  **Loop Through Teller Numbers:** Inside this function, loop through each number of tellers (`N`) in the `teller_range`.\n",
    "3.  **Build Model for N:** For each `N`, construct the specific Birth-Death rate matrix (`Qn`) for a system with `N` tellers using the same λ and μ (this involves an inner helper function `construct_Q`).\n",
    "4.  **Calculate Metrics for N:**\n",
    "    *   Calculate the steady-state probabilities (`π`) for this `N`-teller system using `calc_steady_state(Qn)`.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the traffic intensity `ρ = λ / (μ * N)` for this `N`.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the blocking probability (`blocking_prob`), which is the steady-state probability of being in state `N` (all `N` tellers busy), i.e., `π[N]`.\n",
    "    *   Calculate the utilization (`utilization`), which is the probability that at least one teller is busy (`1 - π[0]`).\n",
    "5.  **Store Results:** Store these calculated metrics (`N`, `ρ`, `blocking_prob`, `utilization`) for the current `N` in a list called `results`.\n",
    "6.  **Define Range to Test:** Create a list `teller_list` containing the number of tellers to analyze. Here, it's set to range from 2 fewer than the actual `max_tellers` (minimum 1) up to 2 more (so, likely [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]).\n",
    "7.  **Run Analysis:** Call the `analyze_varying_tellers` function with the estimated arrival/service rates and the `teller_list`.\n",
    "8.  **Print Results:** Loop through the `results` list and print the key metrics for each number of tellers (`N`) tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output shows a comparison for different numbers of tellers:\n",
    "- **N=3:** With 3 tellers, traffic intensity (ρ) is higher (~0.19), blocking probability is ~1.6%, utilization is ~42.5%.\n",
    "- **N=4:** With 4 tellers, ρ drops (~0.14), blocking drops significantly (~0.2%), utilization stays similar (~42.6%).\n",
    "- **N=5 (Actual):** With 5 tellers, ρ drops further (~0.11), blocking becomes very small (~0.03%), utilization is ~42.6%.\n",
    "- **N=6, N=7:** Adding more tellers further reduces ρ and makes blocking almost zero, while utilization remains around 42.6%.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** This shows diminishing returns. Going from 3 to 4 tellers greatly reduces blocking. Going from 4 to 5 further reduces blocking. Adding tellers beyond 5 has very little impact on blocking (which is already tiny) and doesn't change the overall utilization much in this scenario, suggesting 4 or 5 tellers might be appropriate based purely on these metrics."

    "### Estimating Daily Visits to Full Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** To estimate how many times per day the system transitions *into* the state where all tellers are busy (State 5 in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:** In steady state, the rate of entering a state equals the rate of leaving it. The rate of leaving state `N` (all tellers busy) is given by `π[N] * (total rate out of N)`. The total rate out of state `N` is simply `-Q[N, N]` (the negative of the diagonal element).\n",
    "1.  **Define Function:** Create `full_capacity_visits_per_day` that takes the steady-state probabilities (`π`), the rate matrix (`Q_matrix`), and the number of hours in a day.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Rate Leaving N:** Inside the function, identify the index `N` corresponding to the full state (`Q_matrix.shape[0] - 1`). Calculate the rate of leaving state `N` as `- π[N] * Q_matrix[N, N]`.\n",
    "3.  **Scale to Daily:** Multiply this rate (visits per hour) by the number of hours in the business day (default is 9) to get the expected visits per day.\n",
    "4.  **Run Calculation:** Call the function using the `steady_state` probabilities and the `bd_matrix` calculated earlier for the 5-teller system.\n",
    "5.  **Print Result:** Print the estimated number of visits per day, formatted to three decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Explanation:** The output number (`0.220`) is the model's estimate of how many times, on average, the bank transitions into the state where all 5 tellers are simultaneously busy during a 9-hour day. This is less than once per day, consistent with the very low steady-state probability of being in State 5."

    "# Overall Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of the bank's operational dynamics using Markov Chains, Markov Processes, and the Birth-Death Process has revealed several important insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Queue Management Findings\n",
    "- The bank experiences long queues approximately once per day\n",
    "- The probability of having a long queue at midday is significant\n",
    "- Expected time in a long queue state is approximately 1 hour\n",
    "- After a long queue dissipates, it takes about 9 hours on average before another one forms\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Teller Utilization Findings\n",
    "- Current teller utilization is about [value]%, indicating [efficient/inefficient] resource allocation\n",
    "- The probability of all tellers being busy at midday is [value]%\n",
    "- Adding one additional teller would reduce average wait time by approximately [value] minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recommendations\n",
    "- **Staffing Optimization**: [specific recommendations based on analysis]\n",
    "- **Queue Management**: Implement efficient mechanisms during peak hours\n",
    "- **Service Rate Improvement**: Consider ways to increase service rate during busy periods\n",
    "- **Workload Distribution**: Balance workload across available tellers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "- Expand analysis to account for different days of the week and seasonal variations\n",
    "- Integrate customer satisfaction metrics with operational efficiency metrics\n",
    "- Consider priority queuing for certain customer segments\n",
    "\n",
    "This stochastic analysis provides a quantitative foundation for decision-making that can significantly improve both operational efficiency and customer experience."
